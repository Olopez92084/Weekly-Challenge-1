# Weekly-Challenge-1
First Weekly Challenge

This repo contains the urban octo telegram folder. The original source code for the project. Outside of that it will contain an images folder and a index.html and style.css page containing the refactored code of the completed challenge. I am still having trouble using github and gitbash to commit files, and still get all kinds of odd error messages that I will need some help with during the week. I left notes in the CSS file explaining what every line of codes purpose is. I also trimmed out the redundant and repetitive lines of code to clean it up. The index.html file has working anchor links and descriptions added.
